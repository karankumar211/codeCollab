Collaborative Code Editor (Real-Time)A full-stack, real-time collaborative code editor that allows multiple users to code together in a shared environment. Built with the MERN stack and Socket.io for seamless, low-latency synchronization.🚀 FeaturesReal-Time Sync: Multiple users can edit the same file simultaneously using WebSockets.Multi-Language Support: Integrated with Ace Editor for syntax highlighting.State Management: Powered by Redux Toolkit for predictable UI state.Security: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing and helmet for header security.Optimized Performance: Uses compression and morgan logging on the backend, with Vite for a blazing-fast frontend experience.🛠️ Tech StackComponentTechnologyFrontendReact 18, Vite, Redux Toolkit, Axios, React-AceBackendNode.js, Express.js (v5.x), Socket.ioDatabaseMongoDB (via Mongoose)SecurityJWT, Bcrypt, Helmet, CORS, Cookie-Parser💻 Getting StartedPrerequisitesNode.js (v18+)MongoDB Atlas account or local MongoDB instance1.

2. Backend SetupBashcd server
npm install
Create a .env file in the server directory:Code snippetPORT=5000

Run the development server:Bashnpm run dev
🧩 Architectural BreakdownWebSocket IntegrationThe project uses Socket.io to create a persistent connection between the client and the server. When a user types in the Ace Editor, the change event is emitted to the server, which then broadcasts the delta to all other connected clients in the same "room."Security ImplementationHelmet.js: Configured to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS.Bcrypt: Used for salted password hashing before storing user data in MongoDB.JWT: Securely handles user sessions via HTTP-only cookies.🤖 Brutal Honesty & FeedbackContext missing: I am assuming this project uses "Rooms" to separate different coding sessions, as is standard for Socket.io editors. If it doesn't, you should add that feature next.The "Truth" about your Stack: 1.  Redundancy: You have both bcrypt and bcryptjs in your backend. This is unnecessary bloat. Stick to bcrypt (which is faster) and remove bcryptjs.2.  State Management: For a real-time editor, using Redux for the actual code string might cause performance lag if the file gets large. In a professional setting, we usually handle the editor content via a "Ref" or a dedicated CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) library like Yjs to prevent cursor jumping.3.  Vite vs Express: Your frontend uses Vite (Standard), but your backend uses Express ^5.1.0. Express 5 is still technically in beta/evolving—it's bold for a portfolio, so be ready to explain why you chose the latest version over the stable 4.x in an interview.
